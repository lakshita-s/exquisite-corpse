This project was interesting. I liked making my cat head because I love cats and I enjoyed the process of finding ways to make it interesting with the 'magical' components, like the witch hat (Which I wish I could've coded but. time constraints. my image is cute too.), and the creepy spiral eyes!! It was fun to add the functions for the eyes and the tongue. But I definitely did feel limited in how well I could 'draw' my cat. In my orginal drawing of the full cat, you can see its very natural looking and cute. But since p5 uses shape and more mathematical elements, I found it a bit hard to make the cat as organic and 'natural' as I had envisioned? But I think that was a good challenge- forcing me to make the limited shapes as interesting as I could. To go further, I would make the cat head do something more magical, like hide something in the hat, or such. 

The rest of the exquisite corpse project was interesting. I wanted to do more but felt a bit backed into a corner with the body parts my partner chose (neither my style), and I also wasn't given any space to contribute to the actual making of the two. I still definitely enjoyed my part, and I think our final product is funny and interesting.
